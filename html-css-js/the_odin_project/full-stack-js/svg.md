What is the xmlns attribute?
It is an attribute that indicated that we are working with an SVG image. It specifies that we are working with XML SVG language.

What are some situations where you wouldn’t want to use SVG?
With more complex images. Examples of these are images with a lot of textures, or images way too big.

What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?
When you inline SVGs you have access to all the classes and attributes, so you can reference them in CSS and JS. However, that makes the code harder to read and to load.
